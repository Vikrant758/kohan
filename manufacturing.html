          <p>We have a skilled and experienced engineering team capable of designing and developing new products and
            tooling designs. Our team is proficient in using design and simulation softwares (AutoCAD and SolidWorks).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Once a product is requested, we erase the existing methods and processes to reset our thinking. By doing
            so, we can escape from fixed concepts and come up with fresh ideas to achieve the goal of the product.</p>
          <br>
          <p>In addition to designing new products, our engineering team also focuses on applying VAVE principles to
            existing products to identify opportunities for process improvement. By analyzing the product design and
            manufacturing processes, we can identify ways to optimize the use of materials, reduce waste, and improve
            production efficiency.</p>

          <h2 class="clr-primary text-left">Tool Room</h2>
          <p>We have in-house setup to design and manufacture tools and dies. We have specialised tool room with precise
            machining setups- EDM, CNC and VMC machining processes. These machines are essential for producing
            high-quality and precise tools and dies, critical in the cold forging process, resulting in a more
            streamlined and efficient production process.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>With this setup, we are capable to produce 500+ dies per month, enabling us to meet the critical demands of
            our customers in time. This level of manufacturing capability is a key advantage for us, as it allows us to
            maintain high standards of quality while also being able to scale production to meet the needs of our
            customers.</p>

          <h2 class="clr-primary text-left">Cold Forging
          </h2>
          <p>Cold forging is a manufacturing process in which a metal blank is shaped into a desired form using
            compressive force and dies at room temperature, without the use of heat. The process is also sometimes
            called "cold forming". Cold forging is often preferred over other forming methods for its ability to produce
            high-strength components with excellent dimensional accuracy and surface finish. The process is also more
            efficient than traditional machining methods because it allows for the production of complex shapes in one
            go, rather than requiring multiple operations of cutting and shaping. The process is economical and suitable
            for mass production.

        <div class="manufacture-content">
          <h2 class="clr-primary text-left">Secondary Operations</h2>
          <p>One of our strengths is our ability to manufacture cold forging parts and perform wide range of secondary
            operations on these parts to achieve extremely tight tolerances. This requires advanced machinery,
            specialized tools, and skilled technicians who are able to work with precision and accuracy.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>As a full service provider, we are equipped to carry out a number of CNC, secondary operations and have
            specialised processes. Our secondary operations consist of- power presses, automating crimping machines,
            SPMs (Special Purpose Machines), centreless grinders, slotting machines, VMC machines, broaching machines,
            automatic milling machines, drill machines, and more.</p>

          <h2 class="clr-primary text-left">Thread Forming</h2>
          <p>We have a variety of machines to support the manufacturing of fasteners, including Flat Rolling Machines,
            Round/Circular Rolling Machines, Tapping Machines and Forming Tapping Machines, which are used to create
            internal and external threads in the fasteners. We have acquired most of these machines from Taiwan, which
            is known for producing high-quality and reliable industrial machinery. This ensures that we are using
            state-of-the-art equipment that is capable of producing consistent and high-quality products to meet the
            specific needs of our customers while maintaining tight tolerances and consistent quality standards.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>We have implemented Poka-Yoke on rolling machines to avoid any reverse/missed threads.</p>

          <h2 class="clr-primary text-left">Adhesive Coating</h2>
          <p>Adhesive coating in terms of bolts and studs refers to the application of a specially formulated adhesive
            material to the threads of the fastener. This coating serves to fill gaps between the threads, which helps
            to prevent loosening of the fastener due to vibration or other external forces. Additionally, the adhesive
            coating can help to seal the threads, providing a barrier against the entry of contaminants and moisture.
            Overall, the use of adhesive coatings in bolt and stud applications can help to improve the reliability and
            longevity of mechanical assemblies.</p>
          <br>
          <p>We have solutions for all kinds of adhesives used in fasteners.

          <p>We have two Automatic Chrome free Zinc Plating Plants which are equipped with state-of-the-art technology
            that allows for the plating of fasteners with a variety of passivations. The plants are equipped with
            sensors and continuous data monitoring and recording systems to ensure that the plating process is carried
            out in a consistent and controlled manner. We also have baking ovens for hydrogen debrittlement, which is a
            critical step in the plating process which are used to remove the hydrogen atoms from the metal, which helps
            to prevent hydrogen embrittlement and ensure the strength and durability of the finished fasteners.
